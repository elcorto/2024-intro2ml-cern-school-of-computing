# A multi-layer perceptron with pen and paper

Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) were some of the first Machine Learning (ML) architectures in use.

This notebook will guide you through how to
- perform a forward pass through a very simple MLP
- how to backpropagate through the network
- how to perform the same operations with [pytorch](https://pytorch.org)

## A Feed Forward MLP

Let's recap the essential ingredients of a feedforward neural network:

<div style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 75%;"><img src="img/01_plain_mlp.svg" alt="plain MLP"></div>

In the above, the network receives an input datum $x$. This is used as input to the first hidden unit $\sigma (\boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \vec{x} + \vec{\beta})$. The hidden unit consists of 3 ingredients:
- a weight matrix $\boldsymbol{\omega}$
- a bias vector $\vec{\beta}$
- an activation function $\sigma$

The output of the hidden unit will be considered to be the input of the last layer. This in turn produces the output $\vec{\hat{y}}$ of the forward pass. In order to establish a learning process, this prediction $\hat{y}$ will be compared with a label $y$ using the loss the function $\mathcal{L}(y,\hat{y})$.

# # Supervised Learning
#
# Given a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{\langle \vec{x}_i, y_i\rangle \dots \}$ with input data $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and labels $y \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$, we would like to train a model $f$ with parameters $\varphi = \{ \boldsymbol{\omega}^{I}, \vec{\beta}^{I}, \boldsymbol{\omega}^{II}, \vec{\beta}^{II} \}$ such that:
#
# $$ \vec{\hat{y}} = \hat{f}(\vec{x}|\varphi) $$
#
# To obtain a good estimate of $f$, we alter the weights of our model $\varphi$. To do this, the optimisation is performed using a loss function $\mathcal{L}$ to obtain an optimal set of weights $\varphi$ by minimizing $\mathcal{L}$:
#
# $$ \varphi \approx \text{argmin}_{\varphi} \mathcal{L}( \vec{y}, \vec{\hat{y}} = f(\vec{x} | \varphi) ) $$.
#
# The optimisation is performed using [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent). In this optimisation scheme, we update the parameters $\varphi$ in a step-by-step fashion. After being randomly initialized, the parameters are updated at step $s$ using the weight update rule:
#
# $$ \varphi_{t+1} = \varphi_{t} + \alpha \nabla_{\varphi} \mathcal{L}( \vec{y}, f(\vec{x}|\varphi_{s})) $$
#
# The above equation is called __weight update rule__. Here, the free parameter $\alpha$ is also known as the __learning rate__.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Backpropagation
#
# The central part of gradient descent is how to obtain the value of $\nabla_{\varphi}\mathcal{L}$. This is performed by applying the chain rule of differentiation from the back of the model to the front. For the sake of simplicity, let's say we only have part of a model: $f'(x|\varphi) = \omega \cdot x + \beta = \hat{y}$. To compute the gradient of this simple model $f'$, we have to start from the loss function $\mathcal{L}(y,\hat{y})= (y-\hat{y})^2$:
#
# $$ \nabla \mathcal{L} = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\varphi} $$
#
# The gradient $\nabla$ is calculated for each weight or bias term independently (as they are also used independently during the forward pass).
#
# $$ \nabla_w \mathcal{L} = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \omega} $$
#
# We can now go forward and apply the chain rule to the differential above:
#
# $$ \nabla_w \mathcal{L} = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \omega} = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{y}}\frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial \omega}$$
#
# We can now move forward and evaluate each term of the chain rule expression:
#
# $$ \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{y}} = \frac{\partial (y-\hat{y})^2}{\partial \hat{y}} = 2\cdot(y-\hat{y})\cdot(-1)$$
# $$ \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial \omega} = \frac{\partial (\omega \cdot x + \beta)}{\partial \omega} = x $$
#
# If we now want to compute the value of the gradient, we would have to input concrete numbers to finally apply the weight update rule.
