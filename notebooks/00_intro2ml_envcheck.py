For most of the notebooks, we require the handy [MNIST1D](https://github.com/greydanus/mnist1d) dataset which is both small, versatile and tricky. The dataset can be installed as a `pip` package.

If you are working on CERN's SWAN, you need to install this atop of the LCG `105a` image. To do so, create a new cell below and run the following command in it:
```
!python -m pip install --user mnist1d
```
This will install `mnist1d` in your CERNBox environment.
