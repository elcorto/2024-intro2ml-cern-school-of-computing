Then I \"click\" on properties (some phones call this information) and see that it has 2160 pixels in width and 3840 pixels in height (`2160x3840`).

    "That means, that for the first hidden layer, we require $128 \\cdot 8,294,400 = 1,061,683,200$ parameters. Every hidden layer consists of the weight matrix and a bias vector. The bias vector has the same size as the number of hidden neurons. With this information, we can calculate the number of parameters:\n",

    "CNNs have become extremely popular to use for classification tasks. A classification tries to categorize or classify a given input signal to a fixed number of possible outcomes. In our case, these outcomes are the class labels of MNIST1D. For this reason, we can call our model a classifier now. We have to create an optimizer that takes care of updating the model parameters in a smart way exploiting the gradients of the loss function. We use `AdamW` with default options for the time being. Note, to construct the optimizer, we have to provide all parameters of our model in the constructor so it knows which parameters to adjust."
