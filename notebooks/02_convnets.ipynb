    "On my phone, I go to \"Gallery\", then select a picture. Then I \"click\" on properties (some phones call this information) and see that it has 2160 pixels in width and 3840 pixels in height (`2160x3840`). We ignore for the time being that most of these images are encoded as RGB or RGBA or even something else.\n",

    "input (output shape: 8294400) -> hidden (output shape: 128) -> hidden (output shape: 128) -> hidden (output shape: 128) -> output (output shape: 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "That means, that for the first hidden layer, we require $128 \\cdot 8,294,400 = 1,061,683,200$ parameters. Every hidden layer consists of the weight matrix and a bias vector. The bias vector has the same size as the number of hidden neurons. With this information, we can calculate the number of parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. layer: $128 \\cdot 8,294,400 = 1,061,683,200$ weights, $128$ bias terms, $1,061,683,200+128=1,061,683,328$ parameters\n",

    "In sum, this network would have $1061716481$ parameters. As each trainable parameter in a pytorch model is typically a `float32` number. This would result in the model to be of size $1,061,716,481 \\cdot 4 \\text{Byte} = 4,246,865,924 \\text{Byte} \\approx 3.9 \\text{GiB} \\approx 4.2 \\text{GB}$.

In our case, these outcomes are the class labels of MNIST1D. For this reason, we can call our model a classifyer now. To set up training, we have to set an optimizer. We use `AdamW` with default options for the time being. Note, to construct the optimizer, we have to provide all parameters of our model in the constructor."
