# Contributing Guide

We are happy to receive feedback, questions and concerns!

If you like to contribute, please note that only `.py` scripts are the living
content of this repo. All notebooks are generated by a dedicated GitHub Action
[`.github/workflows/create-notebooks.yml`](.github/workflows/create-notebooks.yml)
using [`jupytext`](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io). Every commit to `main`
will trigger this action and create an automatic commit adding the updated
`.ipynb` files if changes were made to the corresponding paired `.py` files.

A commit in any branch will also trigger a test CI run which will run all `.py`
files as scripts.

Please use the `jupytext` version from `requirements_dev.txt`.
